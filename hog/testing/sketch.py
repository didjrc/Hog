""" Checks for prime numbers 

To find all the prime numbers less than or equal to a given integer n by Eratosthenes' method:

Create a list of consecutive integers from 2 through n: (2, 3, 4, ..., n).
Initially, let p equal 2, the first prime number.
Starting from p, enumerate its multiples by counting to n in increments of p, 
and mark them in the list (these will be 2p, 3p, 4p, ... ; the p itself should not be marked).
Find the first number greater than p in the list that is not marked. If there was no such number, stop. 

Otherwise, let p now equal this new number (which is the next prime), and repeat from step 3.

p = list(range(2,71,1))
